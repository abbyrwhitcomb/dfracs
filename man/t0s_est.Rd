\title{Estimate Structural Breakpoints in CAPM Betas for Multiple Stocks}
\usage{
t0s_est(stocks, market, rf, dates)
}
\arguments{
\item{stocks}{A data frame or matrix of asset returns (each column is a stock, rows are time).}

\item{market}{A numeric vector of market returns over the same time span as `stocks`.}

\item{rf}{A numeric vector of risk-free rates over the same time span as `stocks`.}

\item{dates}{A vector of `Date` objects corresponding to each row of `stocks`, used to label `t0_date`.}
}
\value{
A data frame with one row per stock, including:
\describe{
  \item{stock}{The stock name (column name from `stocks`).}
  \item{t0_index}{The row index corresponding to the estimated breakpoint.}
  \item{t0_date}{The actual date of the estimated breakpoint.}
}
}
\description{
This function estimates the optimal \( t_0 \) in time series CAPM-style regressions for each stock.
The model allows for a change in beta before and after the estimated \( t_0 \), selecting the split that minimizes
the residual sum of squares (RSS) across all valid breakpoints.

\examples{
stocks <- m_logret[, -1]
market <- m_sp500ret[, 2]
rf <- m_sp500ret[, 3]
t0s_est(stocks, market, rf, m_logret$Date)
