#### Consider the time series of U.S. monthly unemployment rates from January 1948 to July 2007 in the file m us unem.txt. These data, which have been seasonally adjusted, are obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

m_us_unem <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "m_us_unem.txt", package = "dfracs"), header = TRUE, skip = 1, sep = "")
m_us_unem$DATE <- as.Date(m_us_unem$DATE, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

plot(m_us_unem$DATE, m_us_unem$VALUE, 
     main = "US Monthly Unemployment Rates",
     type = "l",
     xlab = "Date", 
     ylab = "Unemployment Rate",)

## a: Plot the ACF and PACF of the rates and the diï¬€erenced rates.
acf(m_us_unem$VALUE, 
    main = "ACF of US Unemployment Rates", 
    lwd = 4)

pacf(m_us_unem$VALUE, 
     main = "PACF of US Unemployment Rates", 
     lwd = 4)

diff_m_us_unem <- diff(m_us_unem$VALUE)
plot(m_us_unem$DATE, c(NA, diff_m_us_unem), 
     main = "Differenced US Monthly Unemployment Rates",
     type = "l",
     xlab = "Date", 
     ylab = "Differenced Unemployment Rate",)

acf(diff_m_us_unem, 
    main = "ACF of Differenced US Unemployment Rates", 
    lwd = 4)

pacf(diff_m_us_unem, 
     main = "PACF of Differenced US Unemployment Rates", 
     lwd = 4)

## b: Fit an ARMA model to the data from January 1948 to December 2006. (Hint: Use a model selection criterion to choose the order within a prescribed range of orders.)

ts <- ts(m_us_unem)[,-1]
aic <- matrix(NA, nrow = 6, ncol = 6)
for (p in 0:5) {
  for (q in 0:5) {
    arma <- arima(ts, order = c(p, 0, q))
    aic[p + 1, q + 1] <- AIC(arma)
  }
}
rownames(aic) <- paste("p =", 1:6)
colnames(aic) <- paste("q =", 1:6)
print(aic)
min(aic) #p=5, q=6

## c: Use your fitted model to compute k-months-ahead forecasts (k= 1,2,...,6) and their standard errors, choosing December 2006 as the forecast origin. Compare your forecasts with the actual unemployment rates.

arima5_0_6 <- arima(ts, order = c(5, 0, 6))
forecast <- predict(arima5_0_6, n.ahead = 6)

data.frame(
  `K-months-ahead` = 1:6,
  Forecast = forecast$pred,
  SE = forecast$se
)
```
