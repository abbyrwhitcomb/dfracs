#### The file m_sp500ret_3mtcm.txt contains three columns. The second column gives the monthly returns of the S&P 500 index from January 1994 to December 2006. The third column gives the monthly rates of the 3-month U. S. Treasury bill in the secondary market, which is obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and used as the risk-free asset here. Consider the ten monthly returns in the file m ret 10stocks.txt.

m_sp500ret <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "m_sp500ret_3mtcm.txt", package = "dfracs"), header = TRUE, skip = 1)
m_sp500ret$Date <- as.Date(paste0("01-", m_sp500ret$Date), format = "%d-%b-%y")
m_logret <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "m_logret_10stocks.txt", package = "dfracs"), header = TRUE)

## a: Fit CAPM to the ten stocks. Give point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of alpha, beta, the Sharpe index, and the Treynor index. (Hint: Use the delta method for the Sharpe and Treynor indices.)

stocks <- m_logret[, -1]
market <- m_sp500ret[, 2]  
rf <- m_sp500ret[, 3]      

capm_est <- capm(stocks, market, rf)
capm_est

## b: Use the bootstrap procedure in Section 3.5 to estimate the standard errors of the point estimates of α, β, and the Sharpe and Treynor indices.

boot_est <- data.frame(
  stock = colnames(stocks),
  alpha_se = NA,
  beta_se = NA,
  sharpe_se = NA,
  treynor_se = NA
)

for (i in 1:ncol(stocks)) {
  boot_est[i, 2:5] <- bootstrap_capm(stocks[, i], market, rf)
}
print(boot_est)

## c: Test for each stock the null hypothesis α = 0.

alpha_test <- alpha_capm(stocks, market, rf)
print(alpha_test)

## d: Use the regression model (3.24) to test for the ten stocks the null hypothesis α = 0.
# y_t = alpha + x_t*beta + epsilon_t, 1 ≤ t ≤ n, (3.24)

alpha_test <- alpha_capm(stocks, market, rf)
print(alpha_test)

## e: Perform a factor analysis on the excess returns of the ten stocks. Show the factor loadings and rotated factor loadings. Explain your choice of the number of factors.

excess_returns <- sweep(stocks, 1, rf)
excess_market <- market - rf

cor_mat <- cor(excess_returns)
eigenvalues <- eigen(cor_mat)$values
plot(eigenvalues, type = "b", pch = 16, 
     main = "Scree Plot")

fa <- factanal(excess_returns, factors = 1, rotation = "varimax", scores = "none")
fa

## f: Consider the model ret = β11{t<t0}reM + β21{t≥t0}reM + epsilont,in which ret = rt− rf and reM = rM− rf are the excess returns of thes tock and the S&P 500 index. The model suggests that the β in the CAPM might not be a constant (i.e., beta1 = beta2). Taking February 2001 as the month t0, test for each stock the null hypothesis that β1 = β2.

t0 <- which(m_sp500ret$Date == as.Date("2001-02-01"))
n <- nrow(stocks)
before_after <- as.numeric(1:n >= t0)  

beta <- data.frame(
  stock = colnames(stocks),
  beta1 = NA, beta2 = NA, diff = NA, se_diff = NA, t_stat = NA, p_value = NA
)

for (i in 1:ncol(stocks)) {
  excess_stock <- stocks[, i] - rf
  before <- excess_market * (1 - before_after)
  after <- excess_market * before_after
  model <- lm(excess_stock ~ before + after)
  coefs <- coef(model)
  vcov_mat <- vcov(model)
  beta1 <- coefs["before"]
  beta2 <- coefs["after"]
  diff <- beta1 - beta2
  se_diff <- sqrt(vcov_mat["before", "before"] + vcov_mat["after", "after"] - 2 * vcov_mat["before", "after"])
  t_stat <- diff / se_diff
  p_val <- 2 * pt(-abs(t_stat), df = model$df.residual)
  
  beta[i, 2:7] <- c(beta1, beta2, diff, se_diff, t_stat, p_val)
}

print(beta)

## g: Estimate t0 in (f) by the least squares criterion that minimizes the residual sum of squares over (β1,β2,t0).

t0s_est(stocks, market, rf, m_logret$Date)
```
