#### The file m caus ex.txt contains the monthly Canada/U.S. exchange rate (Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars) from January 1971 to July 2007, which are obtained from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

m_caus <- read.table(system.file("extdata", "m_caus_ex.txt", package = "dfracs"), header = FALSE, col.names = c("Date", "Exchange_rate"), skip = 1, sep = "")
m_caus$Date <- as.Date(m_caus$Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

## a: Plot the time series and its ACF. Are there seasonal eï¬€ects or unit-root nonstationary patterns in the series?
plot(m_caus$Date, m_caus$Exchange_rate, 
     main = "US GDP",
     type = "l",
     xlab = "Date", 
     ylab = "GDP",)

## b: Using the rates from January 1971 to December 2006, build a time series model to forecast the rates in the next 6 months. You can use any of the techniques in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, and economic insights, if available, to build the forecasting model, but should explain your rationale.

real_dates <- subset(m_caus, Date <= as.Date("2006-12-01"))
real_ts <- ts(real_dates$Exchange_rate, start = c(1971, 1), frequency = 12)
model <- arima(real_ts, order = c(1, 1, 1))

## c: Compute the k-months-ahead forecasts (k = 1,2,...,6) based on your fitted model, using December 2006 as the forecast origin. Compare the forecasts with the actual exchange rates.

forcast_dates <- subset(m_caus, Date > as.Date("2006-12-01") & Date <= as.Date("2007-06-01"))
forecast_result <- predict(model, n.ahead = 6)

pred <- forecast_result$pred
actual <- forcast_dates$Exchange_rate
errors <- actual - pred

# Combine and display results
data.frame(
  Month = 1:6,
  Forecast = pred,
  Actual = actual,
  Forecast_Error = errors
)
```
